## SNAKE

This is a simple snake game for CSC 561 final project.

#### Features
- Some basic functions: move, eat food and collision detection.
- Basic process: start, game over and restart.
- Rescord score.
- The speed of the snake will be faster every 50 points.

#### Problems
- UI is really ugly and no sounds, because time is a little tight.
- I didn't code with Object Oriented Programming. Because I am not familiar with JS and WebGL and time is tight, I didn't spend too much time designing classes. This is a bad habit, this program is hard to expend because I don't use OOP.
