I implemented smooth shading with vertex normals by inverting and transposing the model matrix.
I also implemented rendering ellipsoids and they can be manipulated like triangles.

There are some chaging parameters as following:
In part 3, the program translates and rotates view 0.01 each time by pressing corresponding keys.
In part 6, the program translates triangles 0.01 each time by pressing corresponding keys.
in part 6, the program rotates triangles PI/18(10 degrees) each time by pressing corresponding keys.
